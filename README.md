#### About me

I've been programming since 2017 and enjoy building web-based and mobile applications in my spare time. Currently I'm studying Computer Science at UT Dallas and focused on learning more complex algorithms and languages such as Go, Rust, and C++. My main area of interest is API development and its applications, but I intend to branch out into ML, cloud-based computing services, and operating systems.
